#Scrapezillow is no more

![farewell](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02902/nat-geo-summary_2902260b.jpg )

I am sad to say this, but I had to remove scrapezillow from the
internet today. It was found to be in violation of the Zillow EULA so
I had little recourse but to remove it. If you want a EULA friendly
version of the scraper then try the Zillow API. Of course this will
not get one all the information scrapezillow could but I'm sure you'll be able
to manage well enough. It was a fun project to work on while it lasted and
it taught me a lot about data science and web scraping. I was even more
happy that others in the open source community were able to find it of use
to their own projects. Thank you for your contributions and your time.

Sorry it had to end like this
